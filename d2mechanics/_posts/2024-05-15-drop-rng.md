# Background

The goal of this post is to detail the order of events with respect to
usage of the RNG within {{ d2title }} in order to understand how a seeded
game may be used to achieve desired drops or property selection.

The impetus behind starting this research came from [this Reddit post about
a Lower Kurast seed](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo2/comments/hra0zc/found_a_really_nice_lower_kurast_seed/).
A comment from May 29, 2023 discusses how Seed 638589163 can give an easy Ber
rune drop.

[MrLlamaSc](https://www.youtube.com/@MrLlamaSC) posted
[a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1fIGw2Zu4M) even before that on
August 17, 2022 showing how using Seed 100000147 can get an easy Mal rune
drop from an LK chest. [Ginger Gaming Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/@GGMentor)
posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HstDLZX1iQc) about "infinite
Ber rune" drops using the seed from the May 29, 2023 Reddit comment. Ginger
also did some tests in that and other videos trying to discover what affected
the drops from chests and monsters. Some of the results were interesting, because
they seemed to imply that the number of items a player had in their inventory
affected the affixes chosen for an item, but didn't affect the type of item
that dropped.

Knowing that much of {{ d2title }} drop mechanics were already known about and
discussed in lengthy posts about how magic find works and how item generation
works, I assumed someone would have already explained the underlying details
behind this. I asked around on the Phrozen Keep Discord, which appears to be
where the last vestiges of the community from blizzhackers hang out. Blizzhackers
was **THE** place to go in the 2000s and 2010s to get {{ d2title }} internals
information. Their forums were filled with reverse engineering results that
enabled the hacks and mods to exist.

However, it seemed that specific technical detail regarding which RNG type and
how many seeds and which seeds for drops were never written up or discussed.
So that is the real reason for this post.

## Changes

- **2024-05-16**: This was updated to include more technical background
information on random number generation when it was modified to be a post
on this site rather than the PDF as originally released. The algorithm for
determining the {{ gameseed }} and {{ drlgseed }} were also updated.

- **2024-04-15**: The first release of this document (2024-03-13) was reviewed
by Necrolis and Mysterio from The Phrozen Keep Discord. Mysterio rightfully
suggested not to refer to RNG as “good” or “bad,” so that was removed from the
phrasing in the “Takeaway” section. Necrolis also mentioned that some
{{ itemdataseed }}s are saved in the character file. I looked into this, and
the {{ unitseed }} is effectively saved off, but the {{ itemdataseed }} is
generated newly on every new game. The consequence of this can be used to
know ahead of time the stat values that will be rolled on a runeword in a
specific game. More on this will be released in a future version of this
document.

## Version

The following information was derived from the project [D2MOO](https://github.com/ThePhrozenKeep/D2MOO), which has largely
annotated most of the decompiled {{ d2title }} binaries. This project
is based on {{ d2title }} version 1.10f, and thus may not be 100%
accurate for D2R or the latest version of the original D2 Lord of
Destruction, 1.14d. However, according to users more familiar with
the differences, the main drop mechanics surrounding the RNG have
not changed.

The RNG involved in drop mechanics of online {{ d2title }} games is
currently unknown. A fairly reliable source who worked at Blizzard
has mentioned that the game’s server code was patched to use Microsoft’s
cryptographically secure `CryptGenRandom` function for some random 
numbers rather than the source’s built-in MWC RNG, but it is unknown
where exactly this change applies. Others have performed lengthy analysis
on Lower Kurast chest drops in online games to verify that the RNG
does not match the single player game’s. Therefore, this information may
only be relevant for single player games and can explain the
observations of “infinite ber rune” drops using a given game seed as
well as a player’s inventory items affecting an item’s properties but
not the item selection itself.

## Thanks

I’d like to thank all of those individuals (most of whom are from the
Phrozen Keep and blizzhackers) who have done the painstaking work of
reverse engineering and annotating the disassembly and decompilation of
{{ d2title }}. I don’t have enough information about who they are, so
I’m sure I’ll miss many of the early names, but Necrolis, Kingpin,
Mysterio, Pavke, Nefarius, Lectem, Jarulf, Beowulf, McGod, and
Dark_Mage- were all associated in one way or another at some point.

## Past Work

Some great work has been done on understanding the drop mechanics within
{{ d2title }}. However, the understanding and write ups on these mechanics
focused mainly on the high-level details of predicting drop chances and
understanding item and item property selection. Tying those mechanics
to the underlying details of dynamic random level generation (DRLG) and
the exact implementation of RNG has never been written up. Previous write
ups that focus on exact item drop chances, how magic find affects the
equations used to determine drop quality, and chest drop specifics can be
found at:

- [https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Item_Generation_Tutorial](https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Item_Generation_Tutorial)
- [https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo2/comments/13u4tqv/how_does_magic_find_actually_work_an_advanced/](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo2/comments/13u4tqv/how_does_magic_find_actually_work_an_advanced/)
- [https://www.purediablo.com/forums/threads/guide-regular-special-and-sparkly-chests.380/](https://www.purediablo.com/forums/threads/guide-regular-special-and-sparkly-chests.380/)

This is not to say that this knowledge is new. Plenty of groups
throughout the years have understood {{ d2title }}’s internals. When the
server code was identical to the reverse engineered code back in the
day, it was an even more guarded secret on how the internals of RNG
worked so that private groups could exploit it online. The information
here may not be that interesting for general players given that
exploiting it requires the use of a set seed, which is typically viewed
as “cheating” in any competitive environment. If you’re using a seed in
single player specifically to get a high rune or a godly item or
property, why not just use the D2 LoD Hero Editor[^1] or the D2R Hero
Editor[^2]?

## Correction and Contact

If you are more familiar than I am with any of the concepts described in
this document and would like to help my understanding of them, or if you
notice something that is technically incorrect, feel free to contact me
at any of the social media sites listed on this site's main page. I would
be happy to make corrections and credit you.

## Caution

Note that this is not an “all-encompassing” or “definitive” guide to RNG
usage during drop creation and affix and property selection. There are
many specifics and instances of RNG usage that are left out of this
description that would be vital to understand if it was desired to
exploit a specific seed to get the desired item or property on an item.
For example, opening a special chest performs an extra roll on the
{{ objcontrolseed }} random sequence to determine magic or rare quality where
normal chests don’t. An exhaustive list of all of the random rolls like
this would be required in order to utilize a specific {{ gameseed }} sequence
in order to get a specific item or property selection. This paper
presents a high-level understanding of how it all works rather than the
nitty gritty details of every specific usage.


# Introduction

## Random Number Generation (RNG)

Many people have misconceptions about the term "random" when it comes to
random numbers. Some get bogged down in the details about whether a number
is "truly" random. For games and many other applications, however, it doesn't
actually matter. The goal is usually to make something feel non-deterministic.
Game programmers using random numbers typically only care that the value
they're getting is evenly distributed across a range of values. If I want
to make the chance of getting a specific item in my game a 10% chance, then
my random values need to be uniformly distributed so that I can retrieve a
value, divide by 10, get the remainder, check if it's equal to 9, and return
pass or fail. For that to actually be a 10% chance, my sequence of random
numbers must be uniformly distributed well enough that over a reasonable
sample size the check passes 10% of the time. So "random" in games typically
only refers to "uniformly distributed" rather than "true random number
generator" vs "pseudo random number generator."

### RNG in Games

You don't have to take my word for it. Many articles can be found online
about this subject. A well-written post on RNG and how it is used in video games
can be found at [https://medium.com/@naomijoyce/random-number-generation-in-video-games-dda985c5652f](https://medium.com/@naomijoyce/random-number-generation-in-video-games-dda985c5652f)

Random number generation in games can vary depending upon each individual
game's need for random values. In all cases for games, however, pseudo random
number generators (PRNGs) are used. You can think of a PRNG as a huge group of
card dealers. Instead of standard playing cards, however, these dealers' cards simply
have ones and zeros. Their decks are enormous: depending upon the PRNG, the
random string of bits can be 18 quintillion bits long or even longer. Which
dealer you use determines which long string of bits you get. The dealer is
determined by a value called a "seed." The seed is typically chosen by using
a non-deterministic value, like milliseconds since system boot, system
timestamp, etc. Once the individual dealer is chosen by the seed, their
unique deck of zeros and ones is the random sequence of numbers used by the
game to get random numbers. A game can use more than one dealer. It could use
hundreds or thousands. In the end, though, the seed value chooses which sequence
(or deck) is used.

### Multiply with Carry PRNG

The pseudo-random number generator used in {{ d2title }} is a type of
"multiply with carry" (MWC) RNG. This isn't particularly important
outside of understanding that each unique seed contains all the state
for a unique sequence of random numbers, just like in our dealer/deck analogy.
When a random number is "rolled" from a seed, some math occurs to that seed
to transition it to the next random number in the sequence. This math has been
well-researched and is well-understood. The implementation found in
{{ d2title }} follows a method described by George Marsaglia in one of his
papers[^3] and is mathematically sound in how it creates extremely long,
uniformly distributed random number sequences. It even uses a constant
provided by Marsaglia in a Usenet post[^4] giving an x86 implementation
of the MWC.

### RNG in {{ d2title }}

{{ d2title }} has one global {{ gameseed }} that defines one main sequence of
random numbers and is forceable to a specified value using the `-seed`
command line argument when launching the game. If the seed is
not specified, {{ d2title }} mixes values returned from Microsoft Win32's
`QueryPerformanceCounter`, `GetTickCount()`, and `time()` functions to
initialize this {{ gameseed }}.

Two other random sequences the game uses are the {{ drlg }} sequence and the
{{ objcontrolseed }} sequence. The {{ objcontrolseed }} is set to the second random
value in the {{ gameseed }} sequence. The {{ drlgseed }} (which is the Map Seed), is
set to the first random value from the {{ gameseed }} sequence mixed with return
values from `time()` and `GetTickCount()`. However, if a saved character
file has a saved Map Seed already, the game uses the saved value. This allows
single player games to continue using the same map while the {{ gameseed }} and
{{ objcontrolseed }} (which are the sequences used for mobs and drops) continue
to change from game to game. Specifying a specific {{ gameseed }} with the `-seed`
command line argument will keep both the {{ gameseed }} and {{ objcontrolseed }} consistent
from game to game.

</figure>

## Units

All types of objects in {{ d2title }} are **Units**. Monsters, Items, and Objects are
all subtypes of Units. Items include weapons, rings, armor, etc. and can exist
equipped on the player, on a mercenary, in a player's inventory, etc. Objects
include chests, shrines, armor stands, and other interactables within a map. Each
Unit has its own Seed, which we'll call the {{ unitseed }} as well as additional data
specific to the type of object it is. This additional data for Items keeps track
of the item quality, item level, item affixes, etc. including another Seed. We'll
call this other seed the {{ itemdataseed }}.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/drop-rng/item-seeds.png" alt="Item Structure Layout">
  <figcaption>Simplified Example of the Unit and Item Data Structures in {{ d2title }}</figcaption>
</figure>

## Unit Creation

When Units are created in {{ d2title }}, their {{ unitseed }} is assigned as a random
number rolled from one of the multiple random sequences throughout the engine.
If the Unit is an Item, the {{ gameseed }} is rolled to assign the Item's random
seed. The {{ itemdataseed }} is also assigned as a random number rolled from the
{{ gameseed }}. This is true for all Items, including random drops, gambled, vended,
and "preexisting" ones like items on a player or in the player's inventory. They
all need to be initialized, and those items all get new seeds on every game.
This means that when a Player and their inventory, stash, and mercenary are
initialized, all their items are created and two seeds are initialized for each
item by rolling the {{ gameseed }} twice.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/drop-rng/item-seeds-assigned.png" alt="Item Seeds Assigned">
  <figcaption>Example of Two Items Assigned Seeds During Initialization</figcaption>
</figure>

If the Unit is an Object (e.g. a Chest), the game's {{ objcontrolseed }} is used
rather than the {{ gameseed }}. What the ObjectControl is is not important for this
write up, but what is important is that the ObjectControl's Seed is initialized to
a random value from the {{ gameseed }} sequence when the game was created. This occurs
prior to initializing the Player and their items, so the {{ objcontrolseed }} will be
identical for a given {{ gameseed }} regardless of how many items are on a player.

## Dynamic Random Level Generation (DRLG)

When {{ d2title }} needs to generate an area, it uses a method of creating areas,
rooms, and tiles termed Dynamic Random Level Generation (DRLG). The DRLG system
determines an area's layout using complex algorithms, randomization, rulesets for
certain tiles, etc. How all this works is outside the scope of this document, but
the act of loading an area uses a seed called the {{ drlgseed }}. The {{ drlgseed }} just
so happens to be initialized to the very first random value in the {{ gameseed }}
sequence every time an act is loaded. The {{ gameseed }} is not rolled every time an
act is loaded: the first random value rolled from the {{ gameseed }} when the game is
created is saved off and stored in the DRLG system. That singular random value is
used as the {{ drlgseed }} every time an act is loaded, so given a specified Game Seed,
every area should always have the same DRLG area layout.

When the DRLG area creation specifies that an object exists at a tile location (e.g.
a chest in Lower Kurast), that chest object Unit will be created and initialized as
described above, using the {{ objcontrolseed }} to initialize its {{ unitseed }}.
Because the {{ objcontrolseed }} is rolled from the {{ gameseed }} prior to
initializing the player and items, the only variable that affects the chest's
{{ unitseed }} is the point in the {{ objcontrolseed }}'s random sequence at which
the chest is initialized. This variable can be controlled by always initializing the
same number of objects, which can be easy to do, especially if the chest is spawned
near a waypoint, for example. A character loading a game in Act III and then
proceeding immediately to the Lower Kurast waypoint will always initialize the same
number of objects, and so a chest near that waypoint will always get the same
{{ unitseed }}.

# Fresh Meat

## Drop Item Creation

Operating a chest creates item drops slightly differently than killing a monster due
to some unique properties of chests possibly having a chance to be all magic or rare
items and other, higher-level differences. However, the underlying item creation uses
the same code.

When an item drop needs to occur, the game uses the act, the area level ID, and/or
the monster’s level in order to select the appropriate treasure class (see the linked
references in the “Past Work” section above for exact details on treasure class and
item selection). A random chance is then rolled from the {{ unitseed }} (a monster in the
case of a monster being killed or an object in the case of a chest being operated).
The random chance is then checked against the treasure class entries (where a special
“NoDrop” entry is possible) to select a base item. Once the base item type is
selected, all the complex magic find calculations are done. Here, multiple rolls against
the {{ unitseed }} can occur when testing for item quality, including rolls to check for
Unique, Set, Rare, Magic, Superior, then Normal quality.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/drop-rng/item-selection-seeds.png" alt="Item Selection Seeds">
  <figcaption>Example of Item Selection from a Chest's Unit Random Sequence</figcaption>
</figure>

After the base item and its quality are chosen, the actual item unit is created, as
detailed in the “Unit Creation” section above. The overall steps in an item drop are:

1. The DRLG specified a chest object at a specific tile. When the player approaches
close enough to the tile, the chest object unit is created and assigned a {{ unitseed }}
from the ObjectControl random sequence.

2. The player interacts with the chest, causing drop picks to be performed and an item
to be created. The chest’s {{ unitseed }} random sequence is rolled multiple times to
determine which item will drop and the item’s quality.

3. The Item Unit itself is created and assigned a {{ unitseed }} and an {{ itemdataseed }}
from the {{ gameseed }} random sequence.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/drop-rng/item-drop-seeding.png" alt="Item Drop Seeding">
  <figcaption>Order of Random Sequence Operations to Create an Item Unit and its Seeds</figcaption>
</figure>

Remember that the base item and its quality were chosen by rolling random numbers from
the {{ unitseed }} of the monster or object that dropped it, but the drop’s {{ unitseed }}
and {{ itemdataseed }} are chosen from the {{ gameseed }} random sequence. So how do the item’s
{{ unitseed }} and {{ itemdataseed }} affect the item itself?

## Item Affix Property Selection

Immediately after the Unit for the item is created, the item’s stats are assigned. The
stats come from the affixes that are randomly selected from affix groups. There are a lot
of rules and mechanics involved with the affix groups and affixes not being possible or
being more or less likely on certain items, but all of that is outside the scope of this
document. When selecting affixes and then when selecting the exact value of a mod resulting
from that affix, the game uses the {{ itemdataseed }} for all of its random rolls. This means
that the stats on an item are effectively dependent upon the {{ gameseed }} random sequence at
the time of item creation, from which was assigned the {{ itemdataseed }}.


# Takeaway

## Effects on Item Drops

The consequence resulting from the item type/quality itself being chosen
from the {{ unitseed }} and the item properties being assigned based on selections
from the Item Data Seed is that the dropped item type is affected by how many
game objects have been loaded (strictly, dependent upon anything that rolls the
{{ objcontrolseed }}), whereas the properties on the item are affected by rolls
on the {{ gameseed }}. This means that the number of items on a player, in their
inventory, etc. (remember, each item at initialization is assigned two seeds
from the {{ gameseed }} random sequence) affect the properties rolled for an item
drop but not the item itself.

Figure 1 shows an example of a “Jeweler’s Archon Plate of the Whale” with +91 life
being selected from a chest drop with example RNG values from each of the relevant
RNG sequences. This example attempts to show all relevant RNG sequences and the
order in which they’re used in-game.

## Addressing "Bad Seeds"

When watching some streamers grind for specific items (e.g. farming keys for
ubers, running Countess for specific runes, etc.) there is talk every now and
then about possibly having a “bad seed.” This is usually in reference to a
single player game where the map is consistent and a player is not getting the
drops they want after a lot of time playing, so it gives the appearance that
the RNG may be consistently not in their favor due to a "bad seed." However,
although the DRLG map generation is exactly the same on every new game of the
same difficultly, this is achieved by modifying only the DRLG Seed on loading
of a player’s save game file. As is evident from Figure 1, nothing derives from
the DRLG random sequence with respect to item drops. The {{ gameseed }} and
{{ objcontrolseed }} are both randomized on every new game if the `-seed` option
is not used.

Using the `-seed` option is the only way to have a chance of getting consistent
drops, and this is mostly dependent on the {{ objcontrolseed }} being rolled the
exact same number of times at the point when a monster or chest is created.

## Conclusion and Future Work

This write up has described in detail the relevant RNG sequences in play when
creating items and drops in {{ d2title }} LoD (and probably D2R) in single player
mode. The research shown should help to clarify why certain examples of play
sequences while using the `-seed` command line option can lead to consistent
item drops as well as why having different numbers of items on a player when
an item is dropped can change the items properties.

Note that these example RNG rolls and selections do not show the exhaustive
usage of the RNG sequences. There may be other rolls against those seeds and
sequences not shown in the figures. This write up and illustration was meant
to provide an overall picture of the different RNG sequences and the drop
creation mechanism while explaining some of the observations made by the
{{ d2title }} community.

### Perfect Runeword  Rolls Teaser

An interesting part of {{ d2title }} drops that this research did not cover is
item socketing. There are recipes for the Horadric cube that allow a player
to socket items, with the number of sockets applied to the item being a random
chance. Additionally, the variable stats on runewords use RNG. The rolls for
variable stats on runewords use the {{ itemdataseed }} of the rune that is insert
into the object last. Since the {{ itemdataseed }} is recreated for each item on
every new game, it would theoretically be possible to test the result a certain
{{ gameseed }} would give for a runeword or socket roll on a specific item and
only perform the roll when a good seed was seen. This test in online games could
help understand if the RNG on the server was modified in the way that was claimed.
